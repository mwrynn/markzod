COMMENT_LINE $0000 https://roadsidethoughts.com/vectrex/fortress-of-narzod.htm
COMMENT_LINE $0000 this version was "fitted" to be compilable with Vide
COMMENT_LINE $0000 changes made:
COMMENT_LINE $0000 1) exclude all linker stuff
COMMENT_LINE $0000 2) replace all „.“ with „_“
COMMENT_LINE $0000 3) replace LINK with „include“
COMMENT_LINE $0000 4) ensure all RAM locations are „BSS“
COMMENT_LINE $0000 5) changed binary form from 00000000B to %00000000
COMMENT_LINE $0000 6) LDA X (and the like) statments changed to LDA ,X
COMMENT_LINE $0000 7) made 2 new include files for BIOS, RAM and IO locations as in "RUM"
COMMENT_LINE $0000 8) identified missing VAR names and JSR locations
COMMENT_LINE $0000 and added them in "other.i"
COMMENT_LINE $0000 The resulting binary
COMMENT_LINE $0000 could not be directly compared to any known dump, since
COMMENT_LINE $0000 I have no "Revision B" dump - was it every released in cartridge form?
